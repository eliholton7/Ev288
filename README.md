To run my "import data" code, first you have to import my fun_GHCN_data module, and for ease of use, import it as a name to your liking - I chose GHCN. Next, you're going to call the function by typing the name you've given it, (or the module name if you haven't imported it as a specific name) followed by a period and import_data, which is the function name. From there, you have to set it's arguments in parenthesis, which are path_data, file_data, row, column, in that order. Typing integers into the row and column sections will determine the data point you have chosen, and path data and file data are the locations and name of the file that you are analyzing.
