To run my "import data" code, first you have to import the fun_GHCN_data module, and for ease of use, import it as a name to your liking - I chose GHCN. Next, you're going to call the function by typing the name you've given it, (or the module name if you haven't imported it as a specific name) followed by a period and import_data, which is the function name. From there, you have to set it's arguments in parenthesis, which are path_data, file_data, row, column, in that order. Typing integers into the row and column sections will determine the data point you have chosen.
