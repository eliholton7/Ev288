#path data and outpath data for figure--can probably copy code from EDS project.

#import function to read .cv data. Can copy code from fun_des_stats function to read a cdf file. 

#set the variables that im interested in. 

#plot the graph, can likely use code from the fun_gridded_data function, 
# which also reads the cdf file so maybe fun_des_stats is not needed.
